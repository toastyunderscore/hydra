# Hydra
This is a web version of "hydra.exe", which can be seen in [Windows 93](http://www.windows93.net "Windows 93").

# How to use this?
It's pretty simple, just:
* Copy **hydra.js** to your website and include it in the page you want to use it in
* Call the function **"hydra()"** \[or "hydran()", or "hydrone()"\] to start it
* Notes:

   **Make sure to tell the user to enable pop-ups.** (Yes, I know it kind of ruins the fun if they have to enable it, but if you have any
   suggestions, I'm open for ideas.)

   **If the page that started hydra.js is closed, hydra() will stop.** (Alternatively, you can modify hydra.js to have each windows come 
   with a script tag that links directly to hydra.js as well.)
