# Hydra
This is a web version of "hydra.exe", which can be seen in [Windows 93](http://www.windows93.net "Windows 93").

# How to use this?
It's pretty simple, just:
* Copy hydra.js to your website and include it in the page you want to use it in
* Call the function "hydra()" (or "hydran()", or "hydrone()") to start it
* Notes:
...Make sure to tell the user to enable pop-ups. (Yes, I know it kind of ruins the fun if they have to enable it, but if you have any
...suggestions, I'm open for ideas.)
...
...If the page that started hydra.js is closed, hydra() will stop. (Alternatively, you somehow host hydra.js on a code snippet website
...and make it so that hydra(), hydran(), and hydrone() adds a script tag that refers to the hydra.js script url. However, you'd
...need to be able to know what the url will be before you post it.
